# UofT_Social_Network
 
I made a social network web application using Django, Python and Javascript. Using Javascript and Django APIs I was able to make the website more user friendly. I made this to create a platform to allow UofT students to interact, chat, follow and post important events (still working on events). The web app is deployed on heroku (Live Demo):https://dry-peak-75972.herokuapp.com/
